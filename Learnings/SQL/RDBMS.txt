 - stored in electronically.

need of database
 - storing,managing and retrieving amount of data.
 - in one data it is remember incase more amount of data come, so need database for storing.

different types of databases
 - SQL, NoSQL, cloud databases, object-oriented databases, Network databases.

SQL - structured Query Langauge(RDBMS)
 - tables with rows and columns.
 - SQL is interact with database.
 - fixed schema.
 - ACID compliant.
 - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server

 NoSQL - Non structured Query language(Non-RDMS)
 - key-values, graph based, document based.
 - flexiable schema.
 - BASE compliant.
 - MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB.

 ACID Properties
 - Atomicity - Transactions fully completed or failure. In, partial complete it takes as failure.
 - Consistency - work consistencly.
 - Isolation - If read or write in any one operation in database, it couldnot affect the another operations.
 - Durability - once transaction is committed, event of systems fail, it stored the data permanently , not lost.

 MySQL and PostgreSQL are the "software" that manages databases.

 RDBMS - Relational Database Management System.
 - it is a software, manage and store relational data.       Database->software(RDBMS(MYsql,postgresql))->SQL
 - RDBMS use SQL to interact with database.                  Database->software(NRDBMS(MongoDB))->Nosql.
 - tables-> rows and columns.

 - Primary key-> uniquely identify each record on a table, unique identifier in each row.
 - Foreign key-> relationship between primary key and another table.
 - composite key-> It is primary key combining two or more columns.

 - one to one-> one table in single record exactly associated with the another table.
 - one to many-> one record in a table associated with multiple tables. 
 (EX: customer, order the many orders but all orders have only one customer).
 - many to many-> many records in a table associated with many records in another table.
 (EX: customers purchase many products and many products purchased by different customers).


 Mysql
 - fast read and write.
 
 postgresql
 - fast posting.
 - bulk datas post becuase of binary copy method.



 Syntax
DDL - Data Definition Language

create database Shopping;

create table Customers(
  customer_id int,
  first_name varchar(255),
  last_name varchar(255),
  age int,
  country varchar(255)
);

alter table Customers                                   -> add the new column using alter keyword.
add column phone_number varchar(15);

drop table Customers;                                   -> to delete the customer table and data also.
