What is Normalization?
  - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
  - It breaks the large tables into smaller tables and links them using keys.

  Ex: (Aadhar card, PAN crad, Voter ID, Ration Card).

why use normalization/
  - Avoid data duplication
  - Data consistency
  - Easy to update, insert, delete.
  - save storage.
  - Improve query.

Types of Normal Forms.

1. 1NF(First Normal Form)
    - Each column should contain only one row value
    - Ex(wrong statement): John   Math, English
       -> John    Math
       -> John    English

2. 2NF(Second Normal Form)
    - It must be in 1NF.
    - Make sure non-key data fully depends on the key.
    - Ex: studentId   course  studentName
        ->    1        Math     John
    - studentName only depends on studentId not full key(studentId + course).
    - So, split
Student Table:
studentId         StudentName
    1                 John
    2                 Smith

course table:
studentId             course
     1                 Math
     1                 English
     2                 science

3. 3NF(Third Normal Form)
    - Must be in 2NF.
    - No extra non-key columns depending on other non-key columns.
    - Ex:  studentId       deptId         deptName
        ->    1             D01            Computer science
        ->    2             D02            physics
    - deptName depends on deptId not on studentId.
    - so split.
student Table:
studentId         deptId
1                  D01
2                  D02

Dept Table:
deptId            deptName
D01                computer science
D02                physics
